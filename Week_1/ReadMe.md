HW1 - Readme

Before Testing
- make sure your data.txt file is in the correct file directory as the hw files.

Testing:
1) run the command `python mergesort.py`,`python insertionsort.py`, `python insertTime.py` or `python mergeTime.py`.
2) if running either of the `sort.py` code you'll get an out file of either `merge.out.txt` or `insertion.out.txt`. The write file code is set to append the out.txt file so you'll see new inputs from data.txt passed through the sort code appended into the out.txt file. 
3) if running either of the `Time.py` code you'll see the output displayed directly in the terminal. 
4) the `mergeTime` code will run significantly faster than the `insertionTime` code, each code will be tested against the same array of length 7.
